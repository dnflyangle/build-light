- To use ruby-usb you need the libusb-compat-0.1
     - ??? make a new binding for libusb-1.0? - ribusb??
     
- sudo ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install blinky
     - might be a better way of fixing this?
     
- add rescue to usb.rb

- names of usb_control_msg parameters are basically piffle - just send data in them

- need to swap data around for some reason? low order byte * 256?

- Errno::EPIPE: Broken pipe - usb_control_msg
    why does this happen? endpoint initialization?
    
    
------------- ubuntu

no libusb-compat? came automatically in some other package

--------------- window





---- ribusb

none of above necessary - maybe libusb compat is still needed?
